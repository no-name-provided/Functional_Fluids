<b>Fun</b><sub>ctional</sub> <b>Fluids</b> is an example/tutorial mod that demonstrates fluid registration and the implementation of associated
functionality (cauldrons, buckets, etc.). It was created as a response to the state of fluid
documentation, the dysfunction of "official" documentation, and frequent complaints about the difficulty of
implementing fluids. In this mod, you will find full examples of common fluid implementations and copious
documentation in the form of docstrings and comments. It's recommended you pick an example fluid that does
what you want, and follow along while writing your own mod.
  <p>
  Fluid examples include:
  </p> 
<ul>
    <li>Cool Lava - Full recreation of vanilla lava EXCEPT for fire/ignition</li>
    <li>Thick Air - Fully transparent, non-flowing fluid. Balanced alternative to creative flight. Good for airlocks and underwater bubbles</li>
    <li>Configurable Fluid - A fluid with properties specified by the common config. Demonstrates datagenning dynamic fluid models, using common textures, and dynamically tinting items.</li>
</ul>

  It may have errors or inconsistencies. Feel free to make suggestions. Just remember - word of god doesn't mean
  anything when it comes to (Neo)Forge. Don't tell me I'm wrong until you've checked for yourself.
